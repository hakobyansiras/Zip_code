1.1.mia_te_alignment
1.2.mm1s_te_alignment
Single-end RNA-seq data for MM (n=60) and PC (n=22) samples were processed with the STAR aligner and TEtranscripts pipeline

2.mutaion_identification_in_rna_seq
Mutation in TEtranscripts were defined by  by comparison of nucleotides at each position in the  sequence alignment with the “Biostrings” R package
